Increase system default settings
--------------------------------
Params that configure max open connections.
Edit /etc/sysctl.conf and add
    net.core.somaxconn=131072
    fs.file-max=131072

then on the command line:
    sudo sysctl -p

Edit /usr/include/linux/limits.h
    NR_OPEN = 65536
    
Edit /etc/security/limits.conf
    your_username  soft   nofile          65535
    your_username hard    nofile          65535    

limits.conf is read at login, so you should be able to logout and back in for the new
limits to take effect. 

As an alternative, you can run set_kernel.bash to set the kernel parameters at
runtime with even larger values:

    echo "10152 65535" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range
    sysctl -w fs.file-max=128000
    sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time=300
    sysctl -w net.core.somaxconn=250000
    sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog=2500
    sysctl -w net.core.netdev_max_backlog=2500
    ulimit -n 10240
    
    
Stop scaling frequency
------------------------
CPU frequency scaling enables the operating system to scale the CPU speed up or 
down in order to save power. You need to stop this before running any time
based tests.

#! /bin/bash
for i in /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu[0-9]
do
    echo performance > $i/cpufreq/scaling_governor
done

Running Tests
---------------
Before runing any tests, chech settings.py and settings.bash and set the variables for
your system.
